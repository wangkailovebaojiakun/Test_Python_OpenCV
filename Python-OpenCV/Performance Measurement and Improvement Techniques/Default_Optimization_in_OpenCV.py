#OpenCV functions are optimized using SSE2, AVX etc.
#It is enabled by default while compiling. 
#So OpenCV runs the optimized code if it is enabled, 
#else it runs the unoptimized code. You can use cv2.useOptimized() 
#to check if it is enabled/disabled and cv2.setUseOptimized() to enable/disable it.
